# Hippoclaudus Keyword Configuration
#
# Customize these keywords for YOUR work. The conversation scanner uses them
# to score and rank your conversation history by relevance.
#
# Keywords are organized by category. Each category is scored independently,
# so the index output shows WHY a conversation ranked high — not just that it did.
#
# Tips:
# - Be specific: "project-alpha" is better than "project"
# - Include people's names, project codenames, technical terms unique to your work
# - Include partial words for broader matching: "restructur" catches "restructure" and "restructuring"
